- Synthesize and implement the design 
- Generate the bitstream
- Configure ZYNQ and Spartan using the generated bitstream and verify the functionality

###  In the instructions for the tutorial

The absolute path for the source code should only contain ascii characters. Deep path should also be avoided since the maximum supporting length of path for Windows is 260 characters.

**{SOURCES}** refers to *.\\source\\Labn*. You can use the source files from the cloned repository's *sources* directory

**{TUTORIAL}** refers to *C:\vivado_tutorial\\*. It assumes that you will create the mentioned directory structure to carry out the labs of this tutorial

**{BOARD}** refers to target *Boolean* and *Z2* boards. 

## Steps

### Create a Vivado Project                                                 

#### Launch Vivado and create an empty project targeting the Boolean or PYNQ-Z2 board, selecting Verilog as a target language. Use the provided lab1.v and lab1\_zynq.xdc files(For PYNQ-Z2) and lab1_spartan.xdc (for Boolean) from the *.\\sources\\lab1\\* directory.

1. Open Vivado by selecting **Start > Xilinx Design Tools > Vivado 2021.2**
2. Click **Create New Project** to start the wizard. You will see *Create A New Vivado Project* dialog box. Click **Next**.
3. Click the Browse button of the *Project location* field of the **New Project** form, browse to **{LABS}**, i.e. **C:\vivado_tutorial**, and click **Select**.
4. Enter **lab1** in the *Project name* field.  Make sure that the *Create Project Subdirectory* box is checked.  Click **Next**.

<p align = "center">
<i>Various buttons available to view the waveform</i>
</p>

4. Click on the *Zoom Fit* button (![](./images/lab1/Fig19.png)) to see the entire waveform.

   Notice that the output changes when the input changes.

   You can also float the simulation waveform window by clicking on the Float button (![](./images/lab1/Fig20.png)) on the upper right hand side of the view. This will allow you to have a wider window to view the simulation waveforms. To reintegrate the floating window back into the GUI, simply click on the Dock Window button (![](./images/lab1/Fig21.png)).

#### Change display format if desired.

Select **i[31:0]** in the waveform window, right-click, select *Radix*, and then select *Unsigned Decimal* to view the for-loop index in an unsigned *integer* form. Similarly, change the radix of **btn[3:0]** to *Hexadecimal*. Leave the **leds[3:0]** and **e\_led[3:0]** radix to *binary* as we want to see each output bit.

#### Add more signals to monitor the lower-level signals and continue to run the simulation for 500 ns.

1. Expand the **lab1\_tb** instance, if necessary, in the *Scopes* window and select the **dut** instance.

   The btn[3:0] and led[3:0] signals will be displayed in the *Objects* window.

<p align="center">

</p>

5. Close the simulator by selecting **File > Close Simulation**. 

6. Click **OK** and then click **Discard** to close it without saving the waveform.

### Synthesize the Design

#### Synthesize the design with the Vivado synthesis tool and analyze the Project Summary output. 

1. Click on **Run Synthesis** under the *SYNTHESIS* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The synthesis process will be run on the lab1.v file (and all its hierarchical files if they exist).  When the process is completed a *Synthesis Completed* dialog box with three options will be displayed.

2. Select the *Open Synthesized Design* option and click **OK** as we want to look at the synthesis output before progressing to the implementation stage.

   Click **Yes** to close the elaborated design if the dialog box is displayed.

3. Select the **Project Summary** tab and understand the various windows.

   If you don’t see the Project Summary tab then select **Window > Project Summary** or click the **Project Summary** icon![](./images/lab1/Fig29.png).

   <p align="center">
   <img src ="./images/lab1/Fig30.png">
   </p>
   <p align = "center">
   <i>Project Summary view </i>
   </p>

   Click on the various links to see what information they provide and which allows you to change the synthesis settings.

4. Click on the **Table** tab in the **Project Summary** tab.

   Notice that there are an estimated 3 LUTs and 8 IOs (4 input and 4 output) that are used.

<p align="center">
<img src ="./images/lab1/Fig31.png">
</p>
<p align = "center">
<i>Resource utilization estimation summary</i>
</p>

5. In The *Flow Navigator*, under *Synthesis* (expand *Open* *Synthesized Design* if necessary), click on **Schematic** to view the synthesized design in a schematic view.

   <p align="center">
   <img src ="./images/lab1/Fig32.png">
   </p>
   <p align = "center">
   <i>Synthesized design’s schematic view</i>
   </p>

   Notice that IBUFs and OBUFs are automatically instantiated (added) to the design as the input and output are buffered.  The logical gates are implemented in LUTs (1 input is listed as LUT1, 2 input is listed as LUT2, and 3 input is listed as LUT3).  Four gates in RTL analysis output are mapped onto four LUTs in the synthesized output.

   Using Windows Explorer, verify that **lab1.runs** directory is created under **lab1**.  Under the **runs** directory, **synth\_1** directory is created which holds several files related to synthesis.

   ```
   //Directory structure after synthesizing the design
   lab1.runs
   ├─.jobs
   └─synth_1
       └─.Xil
   ```




### Implement the Design

#### Implement the design with the Vivado Implementation Defaults settings and analyze the Project Summary output.    

1. Click on **Run Implementation** under the *Implementation* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

The implementation process will be run on the synthesized design.  When the process is completed an *Implementation Completed* dialog box with three options will be displayed.

2. Select **Open implemented design** and click **OK** as we want to look at the implemented design in a Device view tab.

3. Click **Yes,** if prompted, to close the synthesized design.  The implemented design will be opened. 
4. In the *Netlist* pane, select one of the nets (e.g. led\_OBUF[3]) and notice that the net displayed in the X1Y2 clock region in the Device view tab (you may have to zoom in to see it).

5. If it is not selected, click the *Routing Resources* icon ![](./images/lab1/Fig34.png) to show routing resources. 

   <p align="center">

   <img src ="./images/lab1/Fig37.png">
   </p>
   <p align = "center">
   <i>Implementation results for the Boolean and PYNQ-Z2</i>
   </p>


   Using the Windows Explorer, verify that **impl\_1** directory is created at the same level as **synth\_1** under the **lab1.runs** directory.  The **impl\_1** directory contains several files including the implementation report files.

8. In Vivado, select the **Reports** tab in the bottom panel (if not visible, click *Window* in the menu bar and select **Reports**), and double-click on the *Utilization Report* entry under the *Place Design* section. The report will be displayed in the auxiliary view pane showing resource utilization.  Note that since the design is combinatorial no registers are used.

### Perform Timing Simulation

#### Run a timing simulation.  

1. Select **Run Simulation > Run Post-Implementation Timing Simulation** process under the *Simulation* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The Vivado simulator will be launched using the implemented design and **lab1\_tb** as the top-level module.

   Using the Windows Explorer, verify that **timing** directory is created under the **lab1.sim > sim\_1 > impl** directory.  The **timing** directory contains generated files to run the timing simulation.

2. Click on the **Zoom Fit** button to see the waveform window from 0 to 200 ns.

3. Right-click at 50 ns (where the btns input is set to 0000b) and select **Markers > Add Marker**.  

4. Similarly, right-click and add a marker at around 58.000 ns where the **leds** changes.

5. You can also add a marker by clicking on the Add Marker button ( ![](./images/lab1/Fig39.png)  ). Click on the **Add Marker** button and left-click at around 60 ns where **e\_led** changes.

   <i>Timing simulation output</i>
   </p>

   Notice that we monitored the expected led output at 10 ns after the input is changed (see the testbench) whereas the actual delay is about 8 to 9.7 ns (depending on the board).

6. Close the simulator by selecting **File > Close Simulation** without saving any changes.

### Generate the Bitstream and Verify Functionality

#### Connect the board and power it ON. Generate the bitstream, open a hardware session, and program the FPGA.  

1. Make sure that the Micro-USB cable is connected to the JTAG PROG connector.

2. The Boolean and PYNQ-Z2 can be powered through USB power via the JTAG PROG.

   Make sure that the board is set to use USB power.

## Conclusion 

The Vivado software tool can be used to perform a complete HDL based design flow.  The project was created using the supplied source files (HDL model and user constraint file). A behavioral simulation using the provided testbench was done to verify the model functionality. The model was then synthesized, implemented, and a bitstream was generated.  The timing simulation was run on the implemented design using the same testbench. The functionality was verified in hardware using the generated bitstream.
