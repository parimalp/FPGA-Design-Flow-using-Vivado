###  In the instructions for the tutorial

The absolute path for the source code should only contain ascii characters. Deep path should also be avoided since the maximum supporting length of path for Windows is 260 characters.

**{SOURCES}** refers to *.\\source\\Labn*. You can use the source files from the cloned repository's *sources* directory

**{TUTORIAL}** refers to *C:\vivado_tutorial\\*. It assumes that you will create the mentioned directory structure to carry out the labs of this tutorial

**{BOARD}** refers to target *Boolean* and *Z2* boards. 

## Steps

### Create a Vivado Project 

#### Launch Vivado and create an empty project targeting the XC7S50CSGA324-1(for Boolean) or XC7Z020CLG400-1 (PYNQ-Z2) board, selecting Verilog as a target language. Use the provided Verilog source files, uart_led_pins_{board}.xdc and uart_led_timing.xdc files from the {sources}\lab2 directory.

1. Open Vivado by selecting **Start > All Programs > Xilinx Design Tools > Vivado 2021.2** 

2. Click **Create New Project** to start the wizard. You will see *Create A New Vivado Project* dialog
   box. Click **Next**.
   
3. Click the **Browse** button of the *Project location* field of the **New Project** form, browse to **{TUTORIAL}**,
   and click **Select**.
   
4. Enter lab2 in the *Project name* field. Make sure that the *Create Project Subdirectory* box is checked. Click **Next**.

5. Select **RTL Projec**t option in the *Project Type* form, and click **Next**.

   <p align = "center">
   <i>Create a new project</i>
   </p>

6. Using the drop-down buttons, select **Verilog** as the *Target Language* and *Simulator Language* in the *Add Sources* form.

7. Click on the Green Plus button, then the Add Files… button and browse to the {sources}\lab2
    directory, select all the Verilog files *(led_ctl.v, meta_harden.v, uart_baud_gen.v, uart_led.v,*
    *uart_rx.v, and uart_rx_ctl.v*), click OK, and then click **Next** to get to the Add Existing IP form.

8. Since we do not have any IP to add, click **Next** to get to the *Add Constraints* form.

9. Click on the Blue Plus button, then *Add Files…* and browse to the {sources}\lab2 directory (if
    necessary), select *uart_led_timing.xdc* and click **Open**.

10. Click **Next**.
    This Xilinx Design Constraints file assigns the basic timing constraints (period, input delay, and
    output delay) to the design.

11. In the Default Part form, using the Parts option and various drop-down fields of the Filter section,
    select XC7S50CSGA324-1(for Boolean) or XC7Z020CLG400-1 (PYNQ-Z2).

12. Click **Next**.

13. Click **Finish** to create the Vivado project.

(If you are using PYNQ-Z2)

14. Copy the tcl script `ps_init.tcl` from **{SOURCES}/lab2** to **{TUTORIAL}/lab2**.In the Tcl Shell window enter the following command to change to the lab directory and hit **Enter**. 

```tcl
cd {TUTORIAL}/lab2
```

15. Generate the PS design by executing the provided Tcl script

```tcl
source ps_init.tcl
```

Please check if the path in the tcl script is right or not.

#### Analyze the design source files hierarchy.(Taking Boolean as an example)

1. In the Sources pane, expand the uart_led entry and notice hierarchy of the lower-level modules.

![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig2.png)

<p align = "center">
<i>Opening the source file</i>
</p>



2. Double-click on the uart_led entry to view its content.
   Notice in the Verilog code, the BAUD_RATE and CLOCK_RATE parameters are defined to be
   115200 and 125M Hz(PYNQ-Z2) or 100 MHz(Boolean) respectively as shown in the design diagram . Also notice that the
   lower level modules are instantiated. The meta_harden modules are used to synchronize the
   asynchronous reset and push-button inputs.
3. Expand uart_rx_i0 instance to see its hierarchy.
   This module uses the baud rate generator and a finite state machine. The rxd_pin is sampled at a x16 the baud rate.

#### Open the uart_led_timing.xdc source and analyze the content.

1. In the *Sources* pane, expand the *Constraints* folder and double-click the *uart_led_timing.xdc*  entry to open the file in text mode.

![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig3.png)

<p align = "center">
<i>Timing constraints</i>
</p>

Line 3 creates the period constraint of 10 ns with a duty cycle of 50%. Line 6 creates a virtual clock of 12 ns. This clock can be viewed as the upstream device is generating its output with respect to its clock and outputs data with respect to it. The rxd_pin is constrained with respect to the design clock (lines 9, and 10) whereas the btn_pin is constrained with respect to the upstream clock (lines 12, 13). The led_pins are constrained with respect to the upstream clock as the downstream device may be using it.

### Step 2 Elaborate the Design

### Elaborate and perform the RTL analysis on the source file.

1. Expand the Open Elaborated Design entry under the *RTL Analysis* tasks of the *Flow Navigator*
   pane and click on **Schematic**.
   The model (design) will be elaborated and a logical view of the design is displayed.

![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig4.png)

<p align = "center">
<i>A logic view of the design</i>
</p>

A logic view of the design

You will see four components at the top-level, 2 instances of meta_harden, one instance of
uart_rx, and one instance of led_ctl.

2. To see where the uart_rx_i0 gets generated, right-click on the uart_rx_i0 instance and select Go
   To Source and see that line 84 in the source code is generating it.
3. Double-click on the uart_rx_i0 instance in the schematic diagram to see the underlying
   components.

![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig5.png)

<i>Lower level components of the uart_rx_i0 module</i>
</p>

4. Click on **Report Noise** under the *Open Elaborated Design* entry of the *RTL Analysis* tasks of the
   *Flow Navigator* pane.
5. Click **OK** to generate the report named **ssn_1**.

![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig6.png)

<p align = "center">
<i>Noise report</i>
</p>

6. View the **ssn_1** report and observe the unplaced ports, Summary, and I/O Bank Details are
   highlighted in red because the pin assignments were not done. Note that only output pins are
   reported as the noise analysis is done on the output pins.

7. Click on **Add Sources** under the *Project Navigator*, select *Add or Create Constraints* option and
   click **Next**.

8. Click on the Blue Plus button, then the **Add Files…** button and browse to the *{sources}\lab2*
   directory, select the *uart_led_pins_{BOARDS}.xdc* file (depending on the target board), click **OK**,
   and then click **Finish** to add the pins location constraints.

   Notice that the sources are modified and the tools detect it, showing a warning status bar to reload
   the design.

   ![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig7.png)

9. Click on the **Reload** link. The constraints will be processed.
10. Click on **Report** **Noise** and click **OK** to generate the report named **ssn_1**. Observe that this time
    it does not show any errors (no red).

### Step 3 Synthesize the Design

#### Synthesize the design with the Vivado synthesis tool and analyze the Project Summary output.

1. Click on **Run** **Synthesis** under the *Synthesis* tasks of the *Flow* Navigator pane.

   The synthesis process will be run on the *uart_led.v* and all its hierarchical files. When the process is completed a *Synthesis* Completed dialog box with three options will be displayed.

2. Select the **Open Synthesized Design** option and click **OK** as we want to look at the synthesis output.

   Click **Yes** to close the elaborated design if the dialog box is displayed.

3. Select the Project Summary tab 

   If you don’t see the Project Summary tab then select **Layout > Default Layout** .

4. Click on the **Table** tab in the *Project* Summary tab and fill out the following information.

**Question 1**

Look through the table and find the number used of each of the following:

| Resources | Estimation |

</p>

Notice that IBUF and OBUF are automatically instantiated (added) to the design as the input and
output are buffered. There are still four lower level modules instantiated.

6. Double-click on the *uart_rx_i0* instance in the schematic view to see the underlying instances.

7. Select the **uart_baud_gen_rx_i0** instance, right-click, and select Go To Source.

   Notice that the line instantiated *uart_rx_i0* is highlighted. Also notice that the CLOCK_RATE and
   BAUD_RATE parameters are passed to the module being called.

8. Go back to the schematic, double-click on the *meta_harden_rxd_io* instance to see how the synchronization circuit is implemented using two FFs. This synchronization is necessary to reduce the likelihood of metastability.

9. Click on the (![image-20220222155502208](images/lab2/image-20220222155502208.png) ) in the schematic view to go back to its parent block.

#### Analyze the timing report

1. Click on **Report Timing Summary** under the *Synthesized* *Design* tasks of the *Flow* *Navigator*
   pane.

3. Click **Report Power** under the Synthesized Design, and click **OK** to generate the estimated power consumption report using default values.
   Note that this is just an estimate as no simulation run data was provided and no accurate activity
   rate, or environment information was entered.

![image-20220222143623444](images/lab2/fig14.png)

**Question 3**
From the power report, find the % power consumption used by each of the following:

| Categories | Partition |
| ---------- | --------: |
| FF         |         % |
| LUT        |         % |
| I/O        |         % |
| BUFG       |         % |
