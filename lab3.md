### In the instructions below:

**{SOURCES}** refers to *.\\source\\{BOARD}\\Labn*. You can use the source files from the cloned repository's *sources* directory

**{TUTORIAL}** refers to *C:\vivado_tutorial\\*. It assumes that you will create the mentioned directory structure to carry out the labs of this tutorial

**{BOARD}** refers to target *Boolean* and *Z2* boards.

## Steps

### Open a Vivado Project using IDE

#### Launch Vivado and open the lab2 project. Save the project as lab3 in the {TUTORIAL} directory making sure that the create subdirectory option is selected. Set the flatten_hierarchy setting to rebuilt. Create new synthesis run naming it as synth_2.

1. Start the Vivado if necessary and open either the lab2 project (lab2.xpr) you created in the previous lab or the lab2 project in the labsolution directory using the **Open Project** link in the Getting Started page.

2. Select **File > Project > Save As …** to open the *Save Project As* dialog box. Enter lab3 as the project name. Make sure that the Create Project Subdirectory option is checked, the project directory path is  {TUTORIAL} and click **OK**.

3. Click on the *Settings* in the *Flow Navigato*r pane, select **Project Settings > Synthesis**.

4. Make sure that the *flatten_hierarchy* is set to **rebuilt**, which allows the design hierarchy to be preserved for synthesis, and then rebuilt which is more useful for design analysis because many logical references  will be maintained.

5. Click **OK**.
   
     A Create New Run dialog box will appear asking you if a new run should be created. Click **Yes**
     and then **OK** to create the new run with *synth_2* name.

#### Synthesize the design. Generate the timing summary and analyze the design.

1. Click on **Run Synthesis** under the *Synthesis* tasks of the *Flow Navigator* pane.

   The synthesis process will be run on the *uart_led.v* and all its hierarchical files. When the process is completed a *Synthesis Completed* dialog box with three options will be displayed.

2. Select the *Open Synthesized Design* option and click **OK** as we want to look at the synthesis
    output.

3. Click on **Report Timing Summary** under the *Synthesized Design* tasks of the *Flow Navigator*
    pane.

4. Leave all the settings unchanged, and click **OK** to generate a default timing report, *timing_1*.

5. Click on the link beside the **Worst Negative Slack** (WNS) and see the 8 failing paths.

6. Double-click on the Path 23 to see a detailed view of the path. The path report shows four
    sections: (i) Summary, (ii) Source Clock Path, (iii) Data Path, and (iv) Destination Clock Path.

7. Select Path 23 in the *timing* tab, right-click, and select **Schematic**.
    The schematic for the output data path will be displayed.

</p>

8. In order to see how the Source Clock Path is made up in schematic form, double-click on left end  of the C pin of the FDRE in the schematic.
    This will show the net between the BUFG and C port of the FDRE.
    
9. Similarly, double-click on the left end of the BUFG to see the path between IBUF and BUFG.

</p>

  This corresponds to the Source Clock Path in the timing report.

</p>


Since the virtual clock is slower (12 ns) than the clk_pin period (10 ns for Boolean or 8 ns for PYNQ-Z2), the data path delay includes the clock period of the clk_pin clock source.

![fig1](images/lab3/fig7.png)


<p align = "center">
<i>Worst failing path for the Boolean</i>
</p>

#### Change the design constraint to constrain the virtual clock period to 10ns.Re-synthesize the design and analyze the results.

1. Click **Edit Timing Constraints** under the Synthesized Design.

   The Timing Constraints GUI will appear, showing the design has two create clocks, four inputs, and one output constraints. It also shows the constraints in the text form in the All Constraints
   section.

   ![fig1](images/lab3/fig8.png)

<p align = "center">
<i>Timing Constraints showing 12 ns Virtual Clock period defined (Boolean)</i>
</p>
2. Click in the Period cell of the virtual_clock and change the period from 12 to 10(Boolean) or to 8(PYNQ-z2)

3. Click **Apply**.
    Note that since the timing constraint has changed, a warning message in the console pane is
    displayed to rerun the report.

  ![fig1](images/lab3/figa.png)

4. Click on Rerun.
    Notice that setup timing violations are gone. However, there are still 2 failing paths for the Hold.

![fig1](images/lab3/fig9.png)

 <p align = "center">
<i> Setup timing met</i>
</p>




5. Click on the WHS link to see the paths.

6. Double-click on the first path to see the timing compositions. Notice that the clock path delay
    does not include the entire clock period.

7. Select **File > Constraint > Save **

8. Click **OK** and then click **Yes** to save the synthesized design.
Notice that the Synthesis Out-of-Date status is displayed on the top-right corner.

### Step 2 Implement the Design 
#### Run the implementation after saving the synthesis run. Perform the timing analysis.

1. In the Design Runs tab, right-click on the synth_1 and select **Reset Runs**. Make sure the generated files are deleted. Click **Reset**.

2. Click the **Close Design** link in the status bar. If prompted, do not save anything.


3. Click on the **Run Implementation** in the *Flow Navigator* pane.


4. Click **OK** when prompted to run the synthesis first before running the implementation process.
When the implementation is completed, a dialog box will appear with three options.

5. Select the Open Implemented Design option and click **OK**.

#### View the amount of FPGA resources consumed by the design using Report Utilization.

1. In the *Flow Navigator* pane, select **Open Implemented Design > Report Utilization**. The Report Utilization dialog box opens.

2. Click **OK**.
   The utilization report is displayed at the bottom of the Vivado IDE. You can select any of the resources on the left to view its corresponding utilization.

3. Select Slice LUTs to view how much and which module consumes the resource.

#### Generate a timing summary report.

1. In the *Flow Navigator*, under **Implementation > Open Implemented Design**, click **Report Timing Summary**
The Report Timing Summary dialog box opens.
2. Leave all the settings unchanged and click OK to generate the report.

![fig1](images/lab3/fig11.png)

<p align = "center">

<p align = "center">
<i>First failing path delays for the Boolean</i>
</p>


Compared to delays from the synthesis report, the net delays are actual delays (rather than an estimated figure). The data path delay is longer than the destination clock path delay giving a negative slack (violation). The data path delay is 11.534 ns for the Boolean, the destination clock path is 9.975 ns and the negative slack is -1.559 ns(In this case).
At this point we can ignore this violation as the LED display change by a few nanoseconds won’t be observable by human eyes. We can also change the output delay by $ \approx $ -2 ns and make the timings meet.


5. Select **Implemented Design** > **Edit Timing Constraints** the *Flow Navigator* pane.

6. Select the *Set Output Delay entry* in the left pane, select all the output ports and change the Delay Value to -2.000 ns.

7. Click **OK**, and return to the timing constraints tab, click **apply**

8. Click **Rerun** link to re-run the timing report.
    Observe that the timing violations of the Intra-clock paths are gone.

9. Expand the **Intra-Clock Paths** folder on the left, expand *clk_pin*, and select the Setup group to
    see the list of 10 worst case delays on the right side.

10. Double-click on the any path to see how that is made up of. Also right-click on it and select
    **Schematic**.
    Click on the **Device** tab and see the highlighted path in the view.

11. Select **Open Implemented Design** > **Report Clock Networks**.

12. Click **OK**.
    The Clock Networks report will be displayed in the Console pane showing two clock net entries.

13. Select *clk_pin* entry and observe the selected nets in the Device view.
    The clock nets are spread across multiple clock regions.

## Conclusion
In this lab, you learned about many of the reports available to designers in the Vivado IDE. You had the opportunity to learn basic design analysis tools including the Schematic viewer, delay path properties and reports viewer, Device viewer, and selecting primitive parents. You also learned about the basic timing report options that are at your disposal. You verified the functionality in hardware by typing characters on the host machine and seeing the LED pattern changes.
