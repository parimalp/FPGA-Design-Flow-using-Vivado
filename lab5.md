# Xilinx Design Constraints

## Objectives 

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a I/O Planning project

- Enter the pin locations and IO standards via Device view, Package Pins tab, and Tcl commands

- Create Period, Input Setup, and Output Setup delays

- Perform timing analysis

## Design Description

The design consists of a uart receiver receiving the input typed on a keyboard and displaying the binary equivalent of the typed character on the 8 LEDs.  When a push button is pressed, the lower and upper nibbles are swapped. 

In this design we will use board’s USB-UART which is controlled by the Zynq’s ARM Cortex-A9 processor.  Our PL design needs access to this USB-UART. So first thing we will do is to create a Processing System design which will put the USB-UART connections in a simple GPIO-style and make it available to the PL section. 

The provided design places the UART (RX) pin of the PS (Processing System) on the Cortex-A9 in a simple GPIO mode to allow the UART to be connected (passed through) to the Programmable Logic.  The processor samples the RX signal and sends it to the EMIO channel 0 which is connected to Rx input of the HDL module provided in the Static directory. This is done through a software application provided in the lab5.sdk folder hierarchy.

   <p align = "center">
   <i>Assigning top-level file name</i>
   </p>

11. Select the **Hierarchy** tab and notice that the *uart\_top.v* file has been added to the project with top-level module name as **ios**.  If you double-click the entry, you will see the module name with the ports listing.

    <i>The top-level module content and the design hierarchy after migrating to RTL</i>
    </p>

#### Add the provided source files (from <2018\_2\_zynq\_sources>\lab5) to the project.  Copy the uart\_top.txt (located in the <2018\_2\_zynq\_sources >\lab5) content into the top-level source file.

   *cd C:/xup/fpga\_flow/2018\_2\_zynq\_sources/lab5*

8. Generate the PS design by executing the provided Tcl script.

   *source ps7\_create\_pynq.tcl*

   This script will create a block design called *system*, instantiate ZYNQ PS with one GPIO channel (GPIO14) and one EMIO channel. It will then create a top-level wrapper file called system\_wrapper.v which will instantiate the system.bd (the block design). You can check the contents of the tcl files to confirm the commands that are being run.

9. Double-click on the **uart\_led** entry to view its content.

   Notice in the Verilog code, the BAUD\_RATE and CLOCK\_RATE parameters are defined to be 115200 and 125 MHz respectively.

## Conclusion 

In this lab, you learned how to create an I/O Planning project and assign the pins via the Device view, Package Pins tab, and the Tcl commands. You then exported to the rtl project where you added the provided source files. Next you created timing constraints and performed post-synthesis and post-implementation timing analysis.
