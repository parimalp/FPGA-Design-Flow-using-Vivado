# Xilinx Design Constraints

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a I/O Planning project
- Enter the pin locations and IO standards via Device view, Package Pins tab, and Tcl commands
- Create Period, Input Setup, and Output Setup delays
- Perform timing analysis

## Design Description

The design consists of a uart receiver receiving the input typed on a keyboard and displaying the binary equivalent of the typed character on the 8 LEDs. When a push button is pressed, the lower and upper nibbles are swapped. If you are using a PYNQ-Z2 development board, please make sure that you have a blank microSD card with FAT32 file system.

---

**For PYNQ-Z2:**

In this design we will use board’s USB-UART which is controlled by the Zynq’s ARM Cortex-A9 processor. Our PL design needs access to this USB-UART. So first thing we will do is to create a Processing System design which will put the USB-UART connections in a simple GPIO-style and make it available to the PL section.

The provided design places the UART (RX) pin of the PS (Processing System) on the Cortex-A9 in a simple GPIO mode to allow the UART to be connected (passed through) to the Programmable Logic. The processor samples the RX signal and sends it to the EMIO channel 0 which is connected to Rx input of the HDL module provided in the Static directory. This is done through a software application which has been built on the booting image located in **{SOURCES}/pynq-z2/BOOT.BIN**

**For Boolean:**

Boolean board will be using the on-board UART port to implement such function, without configuring the PS side.

###  In the instructions for the tutorial

The absolute path for the source code should only contain ascii characters. Deep path should also be avoided since the maximum supporting length of path for Windows is 260 characters.

**{SOURCES}** refers to *.\\source\\Labn*. You can use the source files from the cloned repository's *sources* directory

**{TUTORIAL}** refers to *C:\vivado_tutorial\\*. It assumes that you will create the mentioned directory structure to carry out the labs of this tutorial

**{BOARD}** refers to target *Boolean* and *Z2* boards.

   </p>

   Notice that the Find Results tab is opened, and the corresponding entry is shown in the tab.

5. Assign the **rst_pin** input to the pin **J5**(Boolean) or **D20**(PYNQ-Z2).

#### For PYNQ-Z2: Assign output pins led_pins[0] to led_pins[7] to locations B20, W8, U8, W6, Y7, F20, N16, M14. Create them as a vector and assign them using the Tcl command *set_property*. They all will be LVCMOS33.

#### For Boolean: Assign output pins led_pins[0] to led_pins[7] to locations R14, P14, N16, M14, W14, Y14, T11, T10. Create them as a vector and assign them using the Tcl command *set_property*. They all will be LVCMOS33.

**Note:** Notice that PYNQ has four LEDs hence we assign led_pins[3:0] to LEDs and led_pins[7:4] are assigned to PMODB.

1. In the I/O Ports tab, click on the create I/O port button on the left vertical ribbon.

5. Click on **Migrate to RTL**.

The *Migrate to RTL* form will be displayed with Top RTL file field showing **{TUTORIAL}**/io_1.v entry.

1. Change *io_1.v* to **uart_led.v(for PYNQ-Z2)** or **uart_top.v(for Boolean)**, and click **OK**

![images](./images/lab5/Fig12.png)

<p align = "center">
<i>Assigning top-level file name(for Boolean)</i>
</p>


1. Select the **Hierarchy** tab and notice that the *uart_top.v* file has been added to the project with top-level module name as **ios**. If you double-click the entry, you will see the module name with the ports listing.

   ![images](./images/lab5/Fig13.png)

<p align = "center">

</p>

#### Add the provided source files (from {SOURCES}/{BOARDS}/lab5) to the project. Copy the uart_led.txt (located in the {SOURCES}/{BOARDS}/lab5) content into the source file.

1. Click **Flow Navigator > Add Sources**.
2. In the *Add Sources* form, select *Add or Create Design Sources*, and click **Next**.

5. Click **Finish**.
6. Using Windows Explorer, browse to **{SOURCES}\\{BOARD}\lab5** and open uart_top.txt using any text editor. Copy the content of it and paste it in uart_top.vor uart_led.v in the Vivado project.

---

**For PYNQ-Z2, there are two extra steps to take**

1. In the Tcl Shell window enter the following command to change to the lab directory and hit the Enter key.

   ```shell
   cd {TUTORIAL}/lab5
   ```

2. Generate the PS design by executing the provided Tcl script.

   ```tcl
   source ps_init.tcl
   ```
   
   This script will create a block design called *system*, instantiate ZYNQ PS with one GPIO channel (GPIO14) and one EMIO channel. It will then create a **top-level wrapper** file called system_wrapper.v which will instantiate the system.bd (the block design). You can check the contents of the tcl files to confirm the commands that are being run.
   
   **NOTICE**: Please make sure that your top-level module is system_wrapper which generated by the tcl script. If the auto-execute script fails, please manually set the system_wrapper as top. Right click on the **system_wrapper** entry, and click *set as Top*.

---

7. F14Double-click on the **uart_top**(Boolean) or **uart_led**(PYNQ-Z2) entry to view its content.

Notice in the Verilog code, the BAUD_RATE and CLOCK_RATE parameters are defined to be 115200 and 125 MHz(PYNQ-Z2) or 100 MHz (Boolean) respectively.

   - Press Ctrl and select the two rows.
   - Enter the **tco_min** value to be **-0.5 ns** and everything else as **0 ns**. Click **Apply**.
   - Notice that under the Tcl Command Preview tab, 4 Tcl commands have been generated.
   - Click **Next**.

    </p>

14. Note the wizard generated the clk_pin constraint for a 8 ns period (or 125 MHz)(PYNQ-Z2) or 10 ns period (or 100MHz)(Boolean). Notice in the All Constraints window, 7/9 constraints will be created.

    There is no need to click Apply since the constraints have already been applied in the Constraints Wizard.

   [![images](./images/lab5/Fig24.png)](./images/lab5/Fig24.png)

   <p align = "center">
   <i>Failing setup paths</i>
   </p>

3. Click on the *WNS* to see the failing paths.

4. Double-click on the first failing path from the top and see the detailed analysis.

   The output path delay can be reduced by placing the register in IOB.

5. Apply the constraint by typing the following two commands in the Tcl console.

   ***Hint**: The implemented results are dependent on your own computer, if possible, tunning the output delay towards appropriate value to meet the timing constrains. As our testing shows, normally 0 ~ -4 ns will be a practical value.

   ```tcl
   set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk_pin] -min -add_delay -4 [get_ports {led_pins[*]}]
   set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk_pin] -max -add_delay -4 [get_ports {led_pins[*]}]
   ```

## Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to create an I/O Planning project and assign the pins via the Device view, Package Pins tab, and the Tcl commands. You then exported to the rtl project where you added the provided source files. Next you created timing constraints and performed post-synthesis and post-implementation timing analysis.
