# Hardware Debugging

## Objectives 

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Use the Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA) core from the IP Catalog as a debugging tool

- Use Mark Debug feature of Vivado to debug a design

-  Use hardware debugger to debug a design


## Design Description

The design consists of a uart receiver receiving the input typed on a keyboard and displaying the binary equivalent of the typed character on the LEDs.  When a push button is pressed, the lower and upper nibbles are swapped. 

---

**For PYNQ-Z2**

In this design we will use board’s USB-UART which is controlled by the Zynq’s ARM Cortex-A9 processor.  Our PL design needs access to this USB-UART. So first thing we will do is to create a Processing System design which will put the USB-UART connections in a simple GPIO-style and make it available to the PL section.

The provided design places the UART (RX) pin of the PS (Processing System) on the Cortex-A9 in a simple GPIO mode to allow the UART to be connected (passed through) to the Programmable Logic.  The processor samples the RX signal and sends it to the EMIO channel 0 which is connected to Rx input of the HDL module provided in the Static directory. This is done through a software application provided in the lab6.sdk folder hierarchy.  

**For Boolean:**

Boolean board will be using the on-board UART port to implement such function, without configuring the PS side.

###  In the instructions for the tutorial

The absolute path for the source code should only contain ascii characters. Deep path should also be avoided since the maximum supporting length of path for Windows is 260 characters.

**{SOURCES}** refers to *.\\source\\Labn*. You can use the source files from the cloned repository's *sources* directory

**{TUTORIAL}** refers to *C:\vivado_tutorial\\*. It assumes that you will create the mentioned directory structure to carry out the labs of this tutorial

**{BOARD}** refers to target *Boolean* and *Z2* boards. 

## Steps

### Create a Vivado Project using IDE

---

**For PYNQ-Z2:**

#### Launch Vivado and create a project targeting the XC7Z020clg400-1 device, and use the provided tcl script file (ps7_create_pynq.tcl) to generate the block design for the PS subsystem. Also, add the Verilog HDL files, uart_led_pins_pynq.xdc and uart_led_timing_pynq.xdc files from the *<2018_2_zynq_sources>\lab5* directory.

**For Boolean:**

#### Launch Vivado and create a project targeting XC7S50CSGA324-1 parts, and using the Verilog HDL. Use the provided Verilog source files and XDC  files from the **{SOURCES}**\lab6\ directory.

---

1. Open Vivado by selecting **Start > Xilinx Design Tools > Vivado 2021.2**

2. Click **Create New Project** to start the wizard. You will see *Create A New Vivado Project* dialog box. Click **Next**.

3. Click the *Browse* button of the *Project location* field of the **New Project** form, browse to **{TUTORIAL}**, and click **Select**.

4. Enter **lab6** in the *Project name* field.  Make sure that the *Create Project Subdirectory* box is checked.  Click **Next**.

5. Select **RTL Project** option in the *Project Type* form, and click **Next**.

6. Using the drop-down buttons, select **Verilog** as the *Target Language* and *Simulator Language* in the *Add Sources* form.

7. Click on the **Blue Plus** button, then the **Add Files…** button and browse to the ****{SOURCES}**\lab6** directory, select all the Verilog files *(led\_ctl.v, meta\_harden.v, uart\_baud\_gen.v, uart\_led.v, uart\_rx.v, uart\_rx\_ctl.v and uart\_top.v),* click **OK**, and then click **Next**.

8. Click **Next** to get to the *Add Cons*traints form.

9. Click on the **Blue Plus** button, then **Add Files…** and browse to the **{SOURCES}\\{BOARDS}\lab6** directory (if necessary), select *uart\_led\_timing\_{BOARDS}.xdc* and the appropriate *uart\_led\_pins\_{BOARDS}.xdc* and click **Open**.

10. Click **Next.**

11. In the *Default Part* form, use the **Parts** option and various drop-down fields of the **Filter** section, select the **XC7Z020clg400-1**(PYNQ-Z2) or **XC7S50CSGA324-1**(Boolean) part. 

12. Click **Next**.

13. Click **Finish** to create the Vivado project.  

    (If you are using PYNQ-Z2)

14. In the Tcl Shell window enter the following command to change to the lab directory and hit the Enter key.

    ```tcl
    cd {SOURCES}/pynq-z2/lab6
    ```

15. Generate the PS design by executing the provided Tcl script.

    ```tcl
    source ps7_create_pynq.tcl
    ```

    This script will create a block design called *system*, instantiate ZYNQ PS with one GPIO channel (GPIO14) and one EMIO channel. It will then create a top-level wrapper file called system\_wrapper.v which will instantiate the system.bd (the block design). You can check the contents of the tcl files to confirm the commands that are being run. 

16. Double-click on the **uart\_led** entry to view its content.

    Notice in the Verilog code, the BAUD\_RATE and CLOCK\_RATE parameters are defined to be 115200 and 125 MHz(PYNQ-Z2) and 100 MHz(Boolean) respectively.

   You can also click on the **Open recent target** link if the board was already targeted before.

5. The Hardware Session status changes from Unconnected to the server name and the device is highlighted. Also notice that the Status indicates that it is not programmed.

6. Select the device and verify that the **uart\_top.bit** is selected as the programming file in the General tab. Also notice that there is an entry in the *Debug probes file* field.

#### Start a terminal emulator program such as TeraTerm or HyperTerminal. Select an appropriate COM port (you can find the correct COM number using the Control Panel).  Set the COM port for 115200 baud rate communication. Program the FPGA and verify the functionality. 

1. Start a terminal emulator program such as TeraTerm or HyperTerminal.
